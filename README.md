Driver Drowsiness Detection Based on Convolutional Neural Network Architecture Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm

Driver Drowsiness Detection Based on Convolutional Neural Network Architecture Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm this code is the first step of the algorithm used in the paper you can train the model and use transfer learning or finetune on your own dataset, i used Drowsy Detection Dataset that was collected by myself and it is available on my Kaggle account.10.34740/kaggle/dsv/8311245
kaggle datasets download -d yasharjebraeily/drowsy-detection-dataset
